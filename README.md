# TreasureGame 

This is my game. <br>
You need to click on the place where the treasure is hidden.<br>
It works on pure javascript.<br>
I took as a basis the game from the Nick Morgan's book "Javascript for kids" and made changes:<br>
1. Reloading the page when the player loses.<br>
2. Output messages in accordance with the cases of the Russian language.<br>
